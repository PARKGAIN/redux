:::info

While the concepts in the "Basic" and "Advanced" tutorials are still valid, these pages are some of the oldest parts of our docs. We'll be updating those tutorials soon to improve the explanations and show some patterns that are simpler and easier to use. Keep an eye out for those updates. We'll also be reorganizing our docs to make it easier to find information.

**We recommend starting with the [Redux 핵심 튜토리얼](../tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)**, since it covers the key points you need to know about how to get started using Redux to write actual applications.

[기초과정](../basics/README.md)에서, 우리는 간단한 Redux 애플리케이션이 어떻게 구성되는지를 알아봤습니다. 심화과정에서 우리는 AJAX와 라우팅을 전체에 맞게 적용할지 알아보겠습니다.
